Overview:

This project involves developing a Tic Tac Toe game using Java, designed for a human player to compete against a basic AI opponent. The primary focus is to demonstrate the application of core Java concepts such as loops, functions, inheritance, and if-else statements. The AI will use simple rule-based logic rather than advanced machine learning algorithms, making the project accessible and educational for those learning Java.

Objectives:

1. Game Logic Implementation:
    Create a 3x3 grid for the game board.
    Implement rules to determine valid moves, check for win conditions, and detect draws.
    Use loops and if-else statements to manage the game flow.

2. AI Opponent:
    Develop a basic AI that uses predefined strategies to make decisions.
    Ensure the AI can block the player’s winning moves and attempt to win when possible.
    Utilize functions to encapsulate AI decision-making logic.

3. Object-Oriented Design:
   Use inheritance to create a structured codebase.
   Encapsulate common functionalities in base classes and implement specific behaviors in derived classes.
   Demonstrate the use of polymorphism to manage game entities.

4. User Experience:
    Provide a seamless interaction experience where the AI moves automatically after the player’s move.

Key Components:

1. Game Board:
    A 3x3 grid represented by buttons.
    Dynamic updates based on player and AI moves.

2. Player and AI Classes:
    A base class for common functionalities.
    Derived classes for human player and AI, implementing specific behaviors.

3. Game Logic:
    Functions to check for win conditions, draw conditions, and valid moves.
    Loops to iterate through the game board for checking conditions.

4. AI Strategy:
    Functions to determine the AI’s move based on simple rules.
    If-else statements to prioritize blocking and winning moves.

Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game
